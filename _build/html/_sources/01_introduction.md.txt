# Introduction

## What is PyQt?

**Qt** (cute) is a powerful tool that helps developers build **GUI** (Graphical User Interface) computer programs. Imagine making a custom app where you can click buttons, type into boxes, or drag and drop items - Qt makes all of that possible. Itâ€™s like a big box of LEGO, where each block is a tool to design parts of an app. Qt works on many devices, from computers and phones to special-purpose devices like ATMs or car dashboards.

The Qt library is written in C++ which provides low level access to computer hardware. Its flexibility and powerful features means that there is demand for using Qt with other languages. This demand has resulted in language wrappers for many popular languages, allowing developers to access and use the features of Qt.

:class: tip
Code wrappers are like translators that let code written in one programming language talk to code written in another. They work by creating **bindings**, which are special connections that make functions or objects from one language available in another. For example, if you have a Python program and want it to use a library written in C, a wrapper acts as a bridge, using bindings to translate between Python and C so they can work together seamlessly. This allows developers to use the strengths of multiple languages in the same project.
```

**PyQt** (pie-cute) is a Python wrapper for Qt. It brings the power of Qt to your Python projects. This means that instead of using the more complex C++ language, PyQt lets you design the same kinds of apps using Python. With PyQt, you can create windows, buttons, menus, and even games!
